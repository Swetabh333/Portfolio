The system utilizes mutex locks in conjunction with the libcurl library for efficient response management. An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache, implemented using a linked list, optimizes data retrieval. The project leverages the pthread library to achieve multithreaded behavior, effectively managing concurrent operations while mitigating race conditions.",
